## Installation

Install the theme at Firefox's add-ons website (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/animated-colors-light/?src=search). Then, enable the theme in your Firefox preferences.

### Troubleshooting

If the theme does not show, or is removed upon restarting Firefox, ensure that all themes and theme related add-ons (e.g. Firefox Color) are disabled.


## Development

To customize the source code:
* Download the manifest.json and colors.png files.
* Edit the code in the manifest.json file. For a syntax guide, see Mozilla's add-ons website (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme).
* Edit the colors.png (APNG) file. Be sure to link it properly in the manifest.json file.
* Compress the edited manifest.json and colors.png files.
* Sign the edited theme on Mozilla's add-ons developers website (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/developers/).
* Install the edited theme from the website after it has been signed.
